        Data" at (link here)
      10: 4. This database includes integrated and grinding plants including all plants
        that have been proposed or under construction since 2018 and retired or mothballed
        since 2021.

      15: Plants that have been announced in corporate or governmental planning documents,
        but have not begun construction.
      16: Construction of a physical plant facility has begun.
      17: Plant is operating one or more clinker or cement manufacturing unit(s).
      18: Plant has been idled such that it cannot be brought into operation immediately,
        but is not closed. Note that plants undergoing routine maintenance are still
        considered "operating."
      19: Plant has announced plans to retire its cement capacity but has not yet
        ceased operations.
      20: Plant has ceased operations and no longer has the ability to produce clinker
        and/or cement.
      21: Plant previously planned or under development that has been cancelled. If
        no progress or announcements for an announced plant are made after 5 years,
        the plant is considered to be cancelled.
