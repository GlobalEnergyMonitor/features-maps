        11: 5. This database only includes plants with crude iron/steelmaking capacity
          of five hundred thousand tonnes per annum (0.5 MTPA) and greater.

          units at each plant, see the "Steel unit data" and "Iron unit data" downloads.
        14: 8. The GIST is a rebranding of GEM's Global Steel Plant Tracker and Global
          Blast Furnace Tracker, and includes all data previously tracked in those
          datasets.
        15: 9. In the GIST, operating statuses are tracked at the unit-level only.
          This document includes the total amount of capacity under different operating
          statuses at each plant (see the "Plant capacities and status" tab), while
          the "Steel unit data" and "Iron unit data" downloads include the operating
          status of individual furnace units. The "Plant data" tab of this document
          includes start, development, and retirement dates for the entire plant.

          pre-retirement). Descriptions can be found in the definitions above and
          on the methodology page.'
        49: '2. Change to "ISO 14001" and "ISO 50001" field categories: added "expired"
          option.'
        50: 3. All iron and steel capacity is now tracked on the unit-level and aggregated
          to the plant level in the "Plant capacities and status" tab of this document.
        51: 4. The GIST release files include plant-level, iron unit, and steel unit
          download documents. In the plant-level document, plant capacities and status
          are now on a separate tab from other plant data.
        52: '5. Plant production data now includes columns for each production year
          and separate rows for each production type by technology at the plant. '
        53: '6. Change to data fields: "country" field is now "country/area", removed
          the "main production process" and "detailed production equipment" fields
          as the "main production equipment" lists all iron and steel units.'
        54: 7. New unit-level details for BF, DRI, BOF, EAF, and OHF units at each
          plant in the tracker. See the unit-level documents for more information.

          status of individual furnace units. The "Plant data" tab of this document
          includes start, development, and retirement dates for the entire plant.

        48: '1. Change to "Status" categories: Added one new status category (mothballed
          pre-retirement). Descriptions can be found in the definitions above and
          on the methodology page.'
        49: '2. Change to "ISO 14001" and "ISO 50001" field categories: added "expired"
          option.'
        50: 3. All iron and steel capacity is now tracked on the unit-level and aggregated
          to the plant level in the "Plant capacities and status" tab of this document.
        51: 4. The GIST release files include plant-level, iron unit, and steel unit
          download documents. In the plant-level document, plant capacities and status
          are now on a separate tab from other plant data.
        52: '5. Plant production data now includes columns for each production year
          and separate rows for each production type by technology at the plant. '
        53: '6. Change to data fields: "country" field is now "country/area", removed
          the "main production process" and "detailed production equipment" fields
          as the "main production equipment" lists all iron and steel units.'
        54: 7. New unit-level details for BF, DRI, BOF, EAF, and OHF units at each
          plant in the tracker. See the unit-level documents for more information.

          research on changes since the March release of the tracker. This is not
          a comprehensive update covering all new developments. Any adjustments to
          the data have not yet gone through the annual review process. '

          \ of capacity with planned changes before June 1, 2025 \nb. updated development\
          \ and decommissioning dates for this capacity \nc. limited capacity additions\
          \ announced since the March release\nd. adjusted parent field data, now\
          \ configured to include percent stakes assigned to each parent entity when\

        30: Capacity is the tonnes of crude iron or steel per annum that a steel plant
          is capable of producing.
        31: Production is actual tonnes of crude iron or steel per annum produced
          at a plant in a given year.
        32: Additional information about the research method and estimations of capacity
          and production are available on the GEM website at https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-iron-and-steel-tracker/methodology/

          but it has not yet ceased operations.

        42: Furnace(s) ceased operations and is no longer has ability to produce iron
          or steel. If the capacity has been mothballed for over 5 years it is considered
          retired.
        43: Capacity previously planned or under development that has been cancelled.
          If no progress or announcements for announced capacity are made after 5
          years it is considered to be cancelled.
