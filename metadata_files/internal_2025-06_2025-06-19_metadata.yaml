          ownership). Companies IDs, such as PermIDs, are also included.'
        15: "10. Where appropriate, Global Coal Mine Tracker (GCMT) assets have been\
          \ associated with individual remotely-sensed methane plumes described in\
          \ the Global Methane Emitters Tracker (GMET). Plumes are associated with\
          \ a mine asset if the origin of the plume, as determined by the satellite\
          \ data provider, appears to fall within the boundary of a GCMT asset upon\
          \ manual review by a GEM researcher. This manual review involves visual\
          \ inspection of basemap imagery in Google Earth Pro as well as RGB imagery\
          \ (for CarbonMapper plumes) from the time of the plume emission, and analysis\
          \ of government and media sources related to the mine as detailed in the\
          \ GEM wiki pages for individual GCMT assets. Note that the GMET does not\

          or mine project.'
        22: A coal mine where coal removal is occurring for commercial purposes. This
          includes mines that have produced coal within the year, even if operations
          were temporarily suspended for several months.
        23: A coal mine project that has not yet begun operation. This includes projects
          that have been announced (via corporate or government planning documents),
          projects that are under permitting (including feasibility studies), projects
          that are under construction, as well as those in test operation.
        24: A coal mine that is neither operating nor retired, such as those that
          are idled or put on "care and maintenance." Such mines could return to operation,
          but are not currently operating.
        25: A proposed coal mine project for which a cancellation announcement has
          been made by the owning company or government authorities. GEM also assigns
          a status of "cancelled" to projects when no progress has been observed for
          4+ years.
        26: A proposed coal mine project for which no public updates nor progress
          has been observed for 2+ years.
        27: A previously operating coal mine that has been permanently closed.
        28: '"Status detail" describes the mine status on a granular level, such as
          which planning stage a proposed coal mine project has progressed to, or
          whether an operating mine is experiencing temporary work stoppages. '
        29: 'A status assigned when a coal mine project has been described in corporate
          or government plans, but full details remain unknown. '
        30: 'A status assigned when the economic viability of a coal mine project
          is being explored. During the exploration stage, information is gathered

          studies, and the drilling of boreholes. '
        31: A status assigned when permit applications (environmental assessments,
          land use rights, water licenses, etc.) for a coal mine project have been
          filed, but not yet obtained.

        34: A status assigned when a coal mine project begins coal removal, but not
          yet for commercial purposes.
        35: A status assigned when an operating mine temporarily closes, but there
          is potential to recommence operations at a later date. During the care and

        23: "Projects that have appeared in corporate or governmental planning documents\
          \ but have not yet moved actively forward by applying for permits or seeking\
          \ land, coal, or financing.\t\t\t\t"
        24: 'Projects that have actively moved forward in one or more of the following
          ways: applying for environmental permits, acquiring land, acquiring coal,
          acquiring water rights, acquiring transmission arrangements, or securing
          financing. In India the key criterion for moving a project from "announced"
          to "pre-permit" is the existence of a "terms of reference" (TOR) letter
          by the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change. In China, "pre-permit"
          means a feasibility study has been completed.'
        25: Projects that have secured all environmental permits but have not broken
          ground. In India the key criterion for moving a project from "pre-permit"
          to "permitted" is the approval of an "environmental clearance" (EC) by the
          Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change. In China, "permitted"
          means a plant has received a permit from the National Development and Reform
          Commission (NDRC), allowing for construction, or the equivalent approval
          at the province level.
        26: Projects where physical construction (i.e. concrete and steel, not just
          a ground-breaking ceremony or early site preparation) has begun.
        27: Projects where sufficient evidence is found to indicate that a project
          is no longer moving forward, but not enough to declare it definitively cancelled.
          Projects where construction has been put on hold are also considered "shelved."
          A project that shows no activity over a period of 2 years is categorized
          as "shelved" unless there is evidence to the contrary.
        28: In some cases a sponsor announces that it has cancelled a project. More
          often a project fails to advance and then quietly disappears from related
          documents. In addition, a plant that shows no activity or with no known
          developments over a period of 4 years is categorized as "cancelled," unless
          there is evidence to the contrary. Proposed projects that are switched to
          natural gas are considered "cancelled" as coal plants.
        29: Units that have been formally commissioned or that have entered commercial
          operation.
        30: Units that have been deactivated or put into an inactive state but are
          not retired.
        31: Units that have been permanently decommissioned or converted to another
          fuel.

        34: For CO2 calculation method, see "Estimating carbon dioxide emissions from
          coal plants" at https://www.gem.wiki/Estimating_carbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_plants
        35: The GCPT estimates for CO2 emissions are intended to provide guidance
          on overall country and regional emissions over the lifecycle of the existing
          and proposed fleet of plants. They are not intended to provide detailed
          impact analysis for particular plants. For this reason, the average global
          capacity factor is used for all plants. In general, newer plants will tend
          to have higher capacity factors than the average, and older plants will
          have lower capacity factors than the average. Similarly, heat rates and
          emission factors represent broad performance; these factors will differ
          for particular plants and coal supplies.
        36: Lifetime emissions assume a plant lifetime of 35 years, based on the global
          average retirement age of 37 years. Plants older than 35 years are assumed
          to operate an additional 5 years. Plants with a planned retirement date
          are assumed to cease operations that year.
        37: Heat rate is based on type of combustion technology, with performance
          penalties for older and smaller units. More discussion at https://www.gem.wiki/Estimating_carbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_plants
        38: Based on type of coal using the 2006 IPPC Guidelines for National Greenhouse
          Inventories, Table 2.2, page 2.16.
        39: 55% global average, based on GEM's global operating coal power capacity
          and Ember's global coal power generation data (2023).

        5: July 2024 Release Notes
        6: This update covers all regions of the globe, and uses the United Nations'
          Statistics Division definitions of region and subregion.
        7: The column name "Country" has been changed to "Country/Area". The Country/Area
          column presents energy data within various economic contexts, and the geographical
          unit does not strictly follow political boundaries.
        8: GEM ID formats have changed from an L7+5 digit number to L1+11 digit number
          for location IDs and a G7+5 digit number to a G1+11 digit number. Previous
          GEM ID numbers have been preserved. For example, a previous GEM ID of L500064
          is now L100000500064.
        9: Shelved and cancelled statuses have been broken down into two subcategories
          depending on if there was an announcement of delay or cancellation, or if
          the status is inferred by lack of observed progress.

        6: April 2025 Release Notes
        7: "This update covers all regions of the globe, and uses the United Nations\u2019\
          \ Statistics Division definitions of region and subregion. All prospective\
          \ facilities, as well as any for which there was an indication of changed\
          \ status, were researched for updates."
        8: This update now includes all operating and prospective projects with more
          than a 45 MW capacity, lowering the capacity threshold for project inclusion
          from 75 MW to 45 MW.
        9: "The column name \u201CCountry\u201D has been changed to \u201CCountry/Area\u201D\
          . The Country/Area column presents energy data within various economic contexts,\
          \ and the geographical unit does not strictly follow political boundaries."
        10: GEM ID formats have changed from an L8+5 digit number to L1+11 digit number
          for location IDs and a G8+5 digit number to a G1+11 digit number. Previous
          GEM ID numbers have been preserved. For example, a previous GEM ID of L603791
          is now L100000603791.
        11: Shelved and cancelled statuses have been broken down into two subcategories
          depending on if there was an announcement of delay or cancellation, or if
          the status is inferred by lack of observed progress.

          Global Energy Monitor - sophia.bauer@globalenergymonitor.org'
        4: Methodology
        5: September 2024 Release Notes
        6: "This update covers all regions of the globe, and uses the United Nations\u2019\
          \ Statistics Division definitions of region and subregion. "
        7: The Global Bioenergy Power Tracker tracks utility-scale bioenergy power
          station units with capacities of 30 megawatts (MW) or more globally. The
          tracker includes every bioenergy unit at the 30 MW capacity threshold for
          operating, announced, pre-construction and in-construction power station
          units. In some cases, units may combust multiple fuel sources in addition
          to bioenergy. Some units below the 30 MW global threshold are provided for
          some countries when the data were readily available and can be found in
          the "Less than 30 MW" data tab.
        8: "Bioenergy fuel sources are based on the categories included in the chapter\
          \ \u201CBioenergy,\u201D in the IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy\
          \ Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (2011)."
        9: This release includes units that cofire bioenergy fuel sources alongside
          other types of fuel, as well as units that burn bioenergy fuel sources at
          power stations with other units that burn other types of fuel.
        10: "The September 2024 release includes the change from the column name \u201C\
          Country\u201D to \u201CCountry/Area\u201D. The Country/Area column presents\
          \ energy data within various economic contexts, and the geographical unit\
          \ does not strictly follow political boundaries."
        11: The September 2024 release includes the standardization of subnational
          location names for China.
        12: 'The September 2024 release includes a new data field has been added to
          indicate when a project phase is slated for hydrogen production. '
        13: 'The September 2024 release includes a change to shelved and cancelled
          statuses which have been broken down into two subcategories depending on
          if there was an announcement of delay or cancellation, or if the status
          is inferred by lack of observed progress. '
        14: The September 2024 release includes the new format for GEM IDs. GEM ID
          formats have changed from an L2+5 digit number to L1+11 digit number for
          location IDs and a G2+5 digit number to a G1+11 digit number. Previous GEM
          ID numbers have been preserved. For example, a previous GEM ID of L212345
          is now L100000812345
        15: The September 2024 release includes some case changes to the column headers
          in the downloadable dataset, please see the Methodology page for more details.

        29: Notes
        30: Biogas is composed of methane (CH4), which is the primary component of
          natural gas, at a relatively high percentage (50 to 75 percent), carbon
          dioxide (CO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), water vapor, and trace amounts of
          other gases. The energy in biogas can be used like natural gas to provide
          heat, generate electricity, and power cooling systems, among other uses.
        31: 'Agricultural byproducts can be used as a fuel source. Common examples
          include sugar cane pulp (bagasse), rice husks, or palm kernal shells. '
        32: "Syngas made from agricultural waste. To produce syngas, biomass is first\
          \ broken down at high temperature (between 700-800\xB0C) and high pressure\
          \ in a low-oxygen environment. Under these conditions, the biomass is converted\
          \ into a mixture of gases, mainly carbon monoxide, hydrogen and methane\
          \ (sometimes collectively called syngas). To produce a pure stream of biomethane,\
          \ this syngas is cleaned to remove any acidic and corrosive components.\
          \ The methanation process then uses a catalyst to promote a reaction between\
          \ the hydrogen and carbon monoxide or CO2 to produce methane. Any remaining\
          \ CO2 or water is removed at the end of this process."
        33: This fuel type category captures agricultural wastes whose specifics are
          unknown.
        34: Biodiesel is a fuel manufactured domestically from vegetable oils, animal
          fats, or recycled restaurant grease.
        35: Ethanol is a clear, colorless alcohol made from a variety of biomass materials
          called feedstocks. Ethanol is often made from food grains and crops with
          high starch and sugar content, such as corn, sorghum, barley, sugar cane,
          and sugar beets. Ethanol can also be made from grasses, trees, and agricultural
          and forestry residues such as corn cobs and stocks, rice straw, sawdust,
          and wood chips.
        36: Paper mill wastes, sludges, waste water, and black liquor. Black liquor
          is a byproduct of the paper production process that can be used as a source
          of energy. Alkaline spent liquor is removed from digesters in the process
          of chemically pulping wood. After evaporation, the residual "black" liquor
          is burned as a fuel in a recovery furnace that permits the recovery of certain
          basic chemicals.
        37: Landfill gas (LFG) is a byproduct of the decomposition of organic material
          in landfills. LFG is composed of roughly 50 percent methane (the primary
          component of natural gas), 50 percent carbon dioxide (CO2) and a small amount
          of non-methane organic compounds.
        38: Refuse, also called municipal solid waste (MSW), or garbage, is combusted
          to harness energy at waste incinerators. MSW contains 1) biogenic (plant
          or animal products) materials such as paper, cardboard, food waste, grass
          clippings, leaves, wood, and leather products; 2) non-biomass combustible
          materials such as plastics and other synthetic materials made from petroleum;
          3) Noncombustible materials such as glass and metals.
        39: Syngas made from refuse. Syngas is produced through gasification, which
          uses oxygen and water vapor to produce a combustible synthesis gas (syngas)
          from organic compounds in the MSW, which can be used to generate electricity,
          produce chemicals, liquid fuels, hydrogen (H2), etc.
        40: Wastewater sludge can produce biogas through a process of thermal hydrolysis
          and anaerobic digestion.
        41: Biocoal is produced by processing dry biomass in an inert environment
          (no oxygen) at high temperatures, a process referred to as pyrolysis. Depending
          on the temperatures and the characteristics of the end product, the process
          may also be referred to as torrefaction. This process is commonly carried
          out using an indirect-fired rotary kiln.
        42: Includes forestry products and byproducts, scrap lumber, lumber mill byproducts,
          wood chips and pellets, agricultural crops grown for energy production,
          etc.
        43: "Syngas made from wood and other biomass. To produce syngas, biomass is\
          \ first broken down at high temperature (between 700-800\xB0C) and high\
          \ pressure in a low-oxygen environment. Under these conditions, the biomass\
          \ is converted into a mixture of gases, mainly carbon monoxide, hydrogen\
          \ and methane (sometimes collectively called syngas). To produce a pure\
          \ stream of biomethane, this syngas is cleaned to remove any acidic and\
          \ corrosive components. The methanation process then uses a catalyst to\
          \ promote a reaction between the hydrogen and carbon monoxide or CO2 to\
          \ produce methane. Any remaining CO2 or water is removed at the end of this\
          \ process."
