        23: "Projects that have appeared in corporate or governmental planning documents\
          \ but have not yet moved actively forward by applying for permits or seeking\
          \ land, coal, or financing.\t\t\t\t"
        24: 'Projects that have actively moved forward in one or more of the following
          ways: applying for environmental permits, acquiring land, acquiring coal,
          acquiring water rights, acquiring transmission arrangements, or securing
          financing. In India the key criterion for moving a project from "announced"
          to "pre-permit" is the existence of a "terms of reference" (TOR) letter
          by the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change. In China, "pre-permit"
          means a feasibility study has been completed.'
        25: Projects that have secured all environmental permits but have not broken
          ground. In India the key criterion for moving a project from "pre-permit"
          to "permitted" is the approval of an "environmental clearance" (EC) by the
          Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change. In China, "permitted"
          means a plant has received a permit from the National Development and Reform
          Commission (NDRC), allowing for construction, or the equivalent approval
          at the province level.
        26: Projects where physical construction (i.e. concrete and steel, not just
          a ground-breaking ceremony or early site preparation) has begun.
        27: Projects where sufficient evidence is found to indicate that a project
          is no longer moving forward, but not enough to declare it definitively cancelled.
          Projects where construction has been put on hold are also considered "shelved."
          A project that shows no activity over a period of 2 years is categorized
          as "shelved" unless there is evidence to the contrary.
        28: In some cases a sponsor announces that it has cancelled a project. More
          often a project fails to advance and then quietly disappears from related
          documents. In addition, a plant that shows no activity or with no known
          developments over a period of 4 years is categorized as "cancelled," unless
          there is evidence to the contrary. Proposed projects that are switched to
          natural gas are considered "cancelled" as coal plants.
        29: Units that have been formally commissioned or that have entered commercial
          operation.
        30: Units that have been deactivated or put into an inactive state but are
          not retired.
        31: Units that have been permanently decommissioned or converted to another
          fuel.
        32: ''
        33: ''
        34: For CO2 calculation method, see "Estimating carbon dioxide emissions from
          coal plants" at https://www.gem.wiki/Estimating_carbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_plants
        35: The GCPT estimates for CO2 emissions are intended to provide guidance
          on overall country and regional emissions over the lifecycle of the existing
          and proposed fleet of plants. They are not intended to provide detailed
          impact analysis for particular plants. For this reason, the average global
          capacity factor is used for all plants. In general, newer plants will tend
          to have higher capacity factors than the average, and older plants will
          have lower capacity factors than the average. Similarly, heat rates and
          emission factors represent broad performance; these factors will differ
          for particular plants and coal supplies.
        36: Lifetime emissions assume a plant lifetime of 35 years, based on the global
          average retirement age of 37 years. Plants older than 35 years are assumed
          to operate an additional 5 years. Plants with a planned retirement date
          are assumed to cease operations that year.
        37: Heat rate is based on type of combustion technology, with performance
          penalties for older and smaller units. More discussion at https://www.gem.wiki/Estimating_carbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_plants
        38: Based on type of coal using the 2006 IPPC Guidelines for National Greenhouse
          Inventories, Table 2.2, page 2.16.
        39: 55% global average, based on GEM's global operating coal power capacity
          and Ember's global coal power generation data (2023).

        8: "This update covers research on Africa, Americas, Asia, and Oceania as\
          \ defined by the United Nations\u2019 region definitions, as well as global\
          \ updates to 2024 operating projects."
        9: The tracker capacity threshold is 1 MW. Due to research methodology differences,
          projects above 20 MW are published in a separate tab.
        10: Records with a WKSL ID in the Other IDs (unit/phase) column were partially
          or fully sourced from the wiki-solar.org April, 2023 proprietary dataset.

        31: The Country/Area column presents energy data within various economic contexts,
          and the geographical unit does not strictly follow political boundaries.
        32: Preference is for a government provided name. Without that information,
          the name the owner or operating company uses was taken, or the name was
          generated based on project location.
        33: Roman numerals are changed to numbers. If the Owner uses non-sequential
          numbers or other characters, those are used.
        34: Left blank for local languages that use the roman/latin alphabet. Otherwise
          local name in local script provided if possible.
        35: ''
        36: Please refer to "Thresholds for Data Categories" section above.
        37: Capacity may be reported as the DC / peak value the arrays could provide
          or as the AC value of what will be tied into the grid. This is often not
          specified and could be either value when reported as just 'MW'.
        38: Projects for which no information could be found specifying the technology
          type are listed as "Assumed PV" because PV is by far the most common technology.
        39: ''
        40: Latest date was taken when original data source provided a range; Start
          years not included for projects that are cancelled or shelved.
