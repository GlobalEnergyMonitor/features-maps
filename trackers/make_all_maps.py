# STEP 1: Pull all data into a huge df (including about pages) (have local copies of ggit, ggitlng, goit, ggiteu, ggitlngeu)
# STEP 2: Filter based on tracker, geo, and fuel (use what we use for tests)
# STEP 3: Save all data downloads and send to April (for goget use two tabs, for egt pull in last egt tabs for GOGPT)
# STEP 4: Do all adjustments on renamed data
# STEP 5: Make map file by running script for all regions and fuels

# do all data downloads africa, latam, asia, europe
# technically ggit, and ggit lng got updated when egt was updated for egt 
# so those about pages should reflect that egt release date not the global release date
# is that also true for gogpt eu tho? i mean no...
